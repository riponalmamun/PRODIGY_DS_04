# PRODIGY_DS_04

This is my first project (Task 4) from my internship at Prodigy InfoTech , where I dived into the exciting realm of Machine Learning. Here's a breakdown of what accomplished. 

Title: Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

// Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This is an entity-level sentiment analysis dataset of twitter. Given a message and an entity, the task is to judge the sentiment of the message about the entity. There are three classes in this dataset: Positive, Negative and Neutral. We regard messages that are not relevant to the entity (i.e. Irrelevant) as Neutral.
Please use twitter_training.csv as the training set and twitter_validation.csv as the validation set. Top 1 classification accuracy is used as the metric.

I gathered datasets from Kaggle .This process laid the foundation for subsequent analysis. I split the dataset into training and testing subsets and proceeded to train a Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Model. The initial model demonstrated strong performance, achieving an accuracy on the test set.
